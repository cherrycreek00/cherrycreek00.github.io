	<i>Time</i>
	<p>Time is fleeting. It's a resource that I wish I had more of, I'm constantly frustrated watching it slip through my hands. With phrases like,<br>
	'just killing time' or 'I've got too much time on my hands' coming out of my mouth it's clear that I'm two sided in this. When I don't have time <br>
	it's all I want, but when I find myself with too much time, it scares me. Time is like pure potential energy - you can really do anything with it <br>
	When I was but younger I could throw away time like it was nothing and I often did enjoy to throw away time playing video games or reading trash <br>
	novels or watching TV. It felt good to sit and do nothing because my time felt like it would never end. The older I've gotten, the more aware I am <br>
	(sometimes constantly and overwhelmingly) that my days are limited. I like to think that somewhere there is a clock for me which counts down slowly <br>
	for me. Realizing that you will die makes every moment so much more precious, and makes it all the more frustrating when I realize how little I value <br>
	what bit of time I have. I sit over my weekly planner and see what time I have in my schedule to do the things I love. Can I move this here or there <br>
	Or pencil in time for reading and writing. Can I be more vigilent in my evening to not waste time in passivity! When I go off on this extreme, I feel <br>
	so militaristic about my life and it ceases to be fun, but to be more work. Doing the things I love is good because it's in contrast to the things I <br>
	don't want to do. I dont think there has ever been a group of people who did only what they want and never what they don't. Free time and the activities<br>
	I love gain their sweetness by longing for them. today I will exercise moderation; balancing work, passion projects, and none-activity, all in time. <br>

	<i>Church</i>
	<p>I hope I don't sound misanthropic in saying this, but I realized lately that I think the best experiences I've had in churches have been when I'm <br>
	either in an empty church, or visiting a church that I've never been to and don't intend to go to again. I've heard say one time that church would be <br>
	great if it weren't for all the people. There is something to this! Church is holy not because of people, but in spite of them. It is a sad reality <br>
	since the beginnings of Christendom, people have argued and disagreed and fought and done all sorts of wicked things in the name of Christ. It is <br>
	unfortunate, but it is the reality that we cannot have anything without people. Even the most reclusive hermit sees and ministers to the people around <br>
	them and uses their gifts for the larger community. I try to always strive to love everyone and not let them get in my way of loving them. Christianity <br>
	and civilization as a whole isn't easy, and interacting with people is probably the most difficult thing we'll do on any given day, but it is also the <br>
	beautiful and worthwhile thing we can do. We cannot have anything truly lasting without each other.<br>

	<i>The Sea</i><br><br>
	<p>Here's the thing, we're on 12th street. If we keep going we'll be on 13th Street. Got it? I got it but when I'm with people I never want to be alone,<br>
	When I'm alone I can't imagine ever being with people. The sea will be my mistress, my lover. She never lacks for conversation - a steady crash is her <br>
	song. Lay and let her envelop you, lay down in the sand and let her take you away and she will show you true darkness. My foot steps in the sand, happy <br>
	clomping and crunchy along. I look to see things lost in the sea some accidentally and others with intention. long journey to toss it in the sea. I look <br>
	behind and see the people rush madly under warm glowing light. I come to the sea with my illness and she bare what ailment. <br>
	...<br>
	The sea is my lover, before dawn I dive beneth crashing waves. The sea is my lover in dawn's light tucked far away - little when next to her. In sunrise,<br>
	what sunrise? the beach bepeopled slowly, sleepily. Each lovely and lonely with wistful smile. The breeze gives me something and takes away just as much. <br>
	The sea is my lover in endless expanse.<br>

	<i>The Bay Bridge</i><br><br>
	<p>Certain key pieces of architecture loom largely in everyones imagination, especially if they figured somewhat magically in youth. For anyone from <br>
	Maryland, I'd take a bet that the Bay Bridge is one of those pieces of architecture that occupies a place in your mind that stretches further than just<br>
	west to east. My impression of going over the bridge as a child was some kind of awe mingled with terror. The way all the cars would line up and pay the <br>
	entrance fee felt like an amusment ride for automobiles. As a child I grew up in a somewhat rural part of America and for me the largest man made structure<br>
	that I knew was the mall and even the mountains that encircled my hometown were but gentle rolling hills, some distant relative of the Appalachians. The <br>
	Bay Bridge was a massive super structure in my mind, I couldn't imagine how humans could create it! It also had the characteristic of being a gateway to <br>
	a new world. A place not filled with those rolling hills dotted with cows, but someplace swampier lower and smelling of that decay which also makes you <br>
	feel more alive. As I got older and had to travel across the Bay Bridge for work I saw it as a great misfortune. At the time I delivered food to restaurants <br>
	and when I found that my stops lay there on Marylands Eastern Shorn I felt as though cursed. I saw the Bay Bridge as a pinnacle of everything wrong with <br>
	society. It's otherworldy splendor faded away and I saw it was old and coming undone, traffic constantly holding up my deliveries, and I realized that <br>
	everyone going across the bridge (besides myself) was somehow the worst driver I had ever seen! As I'm reflecting on the bridge for this little post, <br>
	I'm finding that I hold a synthesis of the two former ideas and a new third idea! The Bay Bridge is an absolute institution in our hearts and minds <br>
	as I'm sure that many other pieces of local architecture are for many other people, but at the same time, everything in the world is far less than perfect.<br>
	But much like Saint Christopher, the Bay Bridge bares us on her back and takes us across the otherwise uncrossable bay; thanklessly and tirelessly.<br>

	<i>The Old Man</i><br><br>
	<p>"That ye put off concering the former conversation the old man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts; And be renewed in the spirit <br>
	of your mind; And that ye put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness. (Ephesians 4:22-24) <br>
	My life is constantly oriented towards becoming. I see my life as segmented thus; the old man, followed by the man I currently am, followed by the <br>
	man I am to become (the new man). The difficult thing is that you aren't alawys the man you are. Throughout the day I am constantly switching between <br>
	the three. In a moment of weakness or anger I become the old man and i'm inconsiderate or I eat too much, spend too much money or just generally over <br>
	indulge. Other times I am me; the me who everyone expects to be. And other times, though rarely, I can feel myself break through and become the new man <br>
	who is selfless and kind hearted and loves others. Creation is defined by cycles growth and decay running after each other forever. It's important to <br>
	remind myself that I am part of creation and I am very much a part of these cycles of growth and decay and growth. I will never truly put away the old man <br>
	because his purpose is to lead me toward the new man; though I fall I get back up. I'm not trying to justify the behaviors that I have that are less than <br>
	perfect (were it my choice, I would be the new man constantly), but I believe that the perfect love, tenderness, patience, and charitable disposition of <br>
	the new man extends to ourselves. Just as you wouldn't condemn your brother or sister, friend or co-worker, or even someone you've never met, so should <br>
	you not condemn yourself. Give yourself the nurtuting that you need to become the best version of yourself, so you can in turn let it shine out in the world.<br>

	<i>Sunrise</i><br><br>
	<p>One of the practices that has become central to my adult life is to watch the sunrise every morning. Sometimes I'll sit and watch for a while<br>
	and other times it's only a glimpse as I rush off to work, but no matter what I'll always catch a glimpse of the sun peeking over the mountains <br>
	and I'm filled with a sense of newness. The sunrise is creations coming to life - newness and sameness! There is something there for me, the way<br>
	the sunrises every morning yet each is slightly different and unique. As are the days which the sunrise initates, each day can feel samey, but if<br>
	you look at it thoughtfully, you'll see a multitude of small differences. I always like to say we must 'set ourselves up for success' and there are<br>
	few things that so prepare us for success as the sunrise. There is something core in this activity, uniquely human and also unique to creation. <br>
	Humans evolved to stand upright on two legs so that they could orient their gave upward toward heavenly things. Our history is a story of humanity<br>
	constantly being led from the lower to the higher - I always try and remember my place in human history (though often I don't and I find myself<br>
	oriented toward the ground.) But the sunrise is also shared by all of creation! It is the sunflowers cue to start following the sun. It is the <br>
	beginning of the birds song. The bugs begin to rejoice and sing - the sunrise tells creation to come to live and we should respond accordingly!<br>
	Today I will act together with creation and rejoice at the coming of the sun and the beginning of a new day.</p><br>

	<i>Writing</i><br><br>
	<p>I'm really not in love with everything thing I write, in fact, once the words leave my mind and are committed to paper I can't stand to<br>
	read them. I'm sure this is abundantly clear to any eagle eyed reader of The Shaking Reed (or really any reader with a pulse) - typos abound<br>
	in each days entry. I'm not much of an editor anyway, but especially my inability to read what I've written makes mistakes lasting. Each piece<br>
	I write on here is a little piece of me which I send out into the world. I try and give each piece the love and nurturing it requires to grow up<br>
	and become its own, but posting on The Shaking Reed is each pieces leaving home - moving away to be its own thing. It's a heart breaking experience<br>
	but writing is a form of communication at the end of the day. A big notebook full of the greatest words written is nothing if it isn't read.<br>
	A beautiful experience too is reading my own writing that I've written long ago. The years make it not my own and instead of cringe at what <br>
	I've written, I see some greatness in it that I never saw before - as though someone else has written it. My goal with the new direction of The<br>
	Shaking Reed is to overcome this dislike of my writing new and to have an archive of my writing old. And largely to communicate, to hone my ability<br>
	to share the way I see the world with others.<br></p>

	<i>Failure</i><br><br>
	<p>I've been given many opportunities to fail lately, and I've taken every single one of them! Both because I recently started a job that<br>
	I'm not naturally gifted at, and because after a summer off, my driving skills are a little rusty - (and even working on the new life of<br>
	The Shaking Reed has given me chances to mess up things I've never had the opportunity to mess up before). Every day I've forgotten some<br>
	little detail, or mixed two such details up - zigged when I should have zagged. But the point isn't that I feel sorry for myself, in fact<br>
	I'm happy to be surrounded by all these mistakes, in my life I find the easiest way success is by failure. To fail at something is to learn<br>
	a very important lesson. Just reading or hearing about the way to do something is always shallow and I crave to get 'hands on' with a new <br>
	task and see how failure and success feels. Failure sets the goalpast by which success is measured. I've learned little by little to just <br>
	smile at little failures. This is due in large part due to the grace I've been granted as I get older and the way in which humility seems <br>
	to naturally be cultivated. I think that if your humility doesn't increase with your age you're toast! We will never be perfect, but we can<br>
	be happy, caring, and persistent! What hasn't gotten any easier with age is when I fail my family and friends, letting down those whom I love<br>
	deeply. This always gives me the most dreadful gut flight feeling. It's painful to think that I can't be perfect to those that I hold to be<br>
	perfect toward me. Every day we must remind ourselves that we are not the originator of perfection, but it's caretaker. Through hard work<br>
	the fruits of perfection can be ours; humility, tenderness, and love. While I'm not prefect, if i cultivate these fruits, it will get me much<br>
	closer.</p><br>

	<i>Sunlight Filtering Through</i><br><br>
	<p></p>With sunlight filtering through my window these days begin sleepily, the days of my life that are forgotten - lay blank in my journal.<br>
	With sunlight filtering through pine tree needles warmly like stained glass, those days of life where the most noteworth thing is a <br>
	gentle northbound wind that gives momentary relief from the oppressive heat of the day, or days in spent in contemplation, inactive <br>
	as though accidentally. When dinner looms large and the smell of chickpeas roasting with plenty of tomatoes fills the kitchen. These days<br>
	are the currency of life with which we buy our way into Heaven. Happy contemplation and happily content. Time spent with my beloved, but<br>
	do I treasure these rightly? Herein, between life's great joys and great sorrows is the meat of life - but forgotten.<br>

	<i>Address Book</i><br>
	<p>This morning I got a call from a number I didn’t have saved in my contacts, so I answered the way that I answer all calls, in a thick fog of confusion<br>
	(it turned out to be just a coworker confirming plans for the coming day). A huge chunk of all my phone interactions go like this. A number reaching<br>
	out to me that I’m almost certain I know, but am unable to place it. Each time I play along, hoping to figure out who it is based on context clues,<br>
	but I’m sure that my confusion is obvious.<br> 
    One of my worst habits is to periodically (or weekly), I go through my phone and prune my contacts – removing people I haven’t spoke to in a while or<br>
	who maybe I think it best not to talk to. The idea seems to be that if if the contact is out of sight then it is truly and forever out of mind. This<br>
	theory that my mind has come up with would be perfect if not for two uncontrollable variables; first, a massive flaw of the telephone is that it works<br>
	both ways. And second, in life it always seems that you run into the people you’d rather not. It’s funny that this blunt utilitarianism has infected<br>
	just this one annoying aspect of my life. When I think about it deeper, I think this stems from a desire that I have to make things fit into clear<br>
	categories. You’re either in my contact and I talk to you frequently or you’re not and I don’t. This removes entirely the maybe, the occasionally,<br>
	the rekindling. More importantly It removes grace and forgiveness. Lose my number taken to heart. It is almost always a way of avoiding people. Placing<br>
	them forever in the not speaking category of my life. Its shocking to realize that within me is a desire to destroy connection. When all life is IS<br>
	connection – connection of all living things on the living planet with the living God. Humanity has a great power, to build or destroy; to connect or<br>
	sever. Today I will keep everyone in my contact list. I will reach out – connect!<br></p>

 <i>Some Thoughts on Technology</i><br><br>
 <p>I had an entire different Reed planned out for today, but after running into several technical issues, I lost the file. And surely I could re-write<br>
 it, but I think this is an even better opportunity to talk about technology. When I was young, my family was all but certain that I would one day <br>
 start my tech empire because I was able to play games on the family computer and when I unplugged the wifi, counted to 15, and plugged it back in,<br>
 it worked. Technology was something that I loved the fruits of as a child - it felt that it had no limit, I could be anyone and access anything. <br>
 As I got older I started to read books more and I felt a new kind of magic. one which surpassed the feeling that technology gave me as a child. <br?>
 I was exposed to new ideas and ways of looking at life (especially influential was Kerouac, Tolstoy, and Ellul). My late teens and early twenties<br>
 were defined by a desire to be connected to the world and to people. And I, granted not entirely in error, saw that the massive amounts of technology<br>
 that defined our lives; cars, computers, smart phones, and the endless feed of media, really seperated us from one another and creation. And I lived <br>
 for a few years as a wanna-be luddite. Now, seemingly a product of getting older, I see technology for what it is - simply a tool. A tool that is <br>
 often used for evil and for profit. Used to divide and conquer us. To distract and pacify, but ultimately a tool. A tool that should I choose, I <br>
 can use to share my love of life. Pivotal in my new understanding was the knowledge that not all technology has to been designed to be mindless. <br>
 Some computer operating systems are designed to be obtuse, making everything difficult. Cars with manual transmissions. Even printing out a map. <br>
 I've found a systhensis of being able to use these tools for good, but making them obtuse enough that they don't become as part of my life as <br>
 breathing, smiling, walking, feeling. It would be silly to eschew hammers because it allowed me to do something I couldn't do with my hands, but<br>
 at the same time it would be silly to make a hammer my entire identity. I am thankful for moderation and the ability to share the thoughts in my<br>
 mind with you all.<br></p>

 <i>I think...</i><br>
 I like to think a lot when I’m out on my daily walks in the park. To really let me mind run as wild as it wants – sometimes it’s crucial to reel<br>
 your mind in or else you’ll spiral, but like a dog on a retractable leash, it’s good to let it run! I think about all the people I see in the<br>
 park. Out walking and enjoying the day, playing with their children, or two lovers sitting and feeding the ducks. Everyone has their own memories<br>
 and thoughts and feelings, opinions which remain almost entirely unaccessable to me. And everyone has their own death they must die that they<br> 
 carry hidden within them. I wonder how they think about death and do they do so often?<br> 
 I think about the geese too – just as soon as they get settled from the big trek northward they’re heading back south for the winter. Are these<br>
 geese here the same ones as last year and next year will these same geese go else where? Where will they go to?<br>
 I think about smoking a cigarette (though, I haven’t had one in almost a year). Which gets me to thinking about all my friends. What joys and<br>
 struggles have they encountered today? I could reach out and call, but that would make everything real and tangible. I wouldn’t ponder any more,<br>
 but I would know. On my walks, the last thing I want is reality. When I walk, I try to communicate with something larger. The vast movement of<br>
 the Earth is real, I have to hold on tight, I’m spinning, all at once, thousand of miles per hour through space. My connection to every living<br>
 thing ceases to be religious doctrine because I realize that it’s obvious fact. The questions I have on my walks feel like questions in as much<br>
 as I ask them, but the fruit of the question isn’t in the answer, it’s in the asking and in the pondering!<br> 
	I love to walk and to walk and to feel alive It is important to me! To get out into the big connected world and to be the movement of creation!<br>

   <i>Ora Et Labora</i><br>
  <p>It seems that in the mid-Atlantic summer is coming to a close. The heat has broken and a cool breeze blows the trees – soon all the tomatoes will<br>
  be harvested and inevitably I’ve found myself at work again. I thought for certain I would feel that remiss for not going to the beach more and a<br> 
  longing for long hours of solitude, but I felt new and alive. The cool morning air filled my lungs and I noticed that I hadn’t smelled the early<br> 
  morning in a long time. The beach air fills your lungs in a way that’s hot and full of sun, but the air that fills my lungs on a work day propels<br>
  me forward. I’m surprised too to find that I missed the down time in my job. When my body is working and my mind floats off elsewhere, or when I<br>
  am sitting and waiting in the space between the end of one task and the beginning of another. Time enough to think but not enough to sleep. In<br> 
  this down time I found incredible treasures that I had been seeking out all summer. In fact, I found the future of The Shaking Reed in one of these<br>
  layovers. When my mind is truly open and not distracted, it’s truly open to ideas to God. A vessel can’t be filled unless it is first emptied. It<br>
  reminds me what David Lynch said, “catching the big fish”. But sometimes just trying to open my mind I get all distracted – my labor and my lesiure<br>
  are tied. My labor is the bridge connecting the idea to my mind, it is ora et labora. The Smile on a child’s face, standing back to look on<br>
  projected completed, small talk with a coworker, and even the challenges of working too. All these are tools my mind uses to organize my thoughts.<br>
  Labor is what connects me to the world. Working diminishes the me that only thinks of me. To work is to acknowledge that we all need each other.<br>
  I leisure to labor so I can wait on God and the big ideas.<br><br>
