	<i>Address Book</i><br><br>

	This morning I got a call from a number I didn’t have saved in my contacts, so I answered the way that I answer all calls, in a thick fog of confusion<br>
	(it turned out to be just a coworker confirming plans for the coming day). A huge chunk of all my phone interactions go like this. A number reaching<br>
	out to me that I’m almost certain I know, but am unable to place it. Each time I play along, hoping to figure out who it is based on context clues,<br>
	but I’m sure that my confusion is obvious.<br> 
    One of my worst habits is to periodically (or weekly), I go through my phone and prune my contacts – removing people I haven’t spoke to in a while or<br>
	who maybe I think it best not to talk to. The idea seems to be that if if the contact is out of sight then it is truly and forever out of mind. This<br>
	theory that my mind has come up with would be perfect if not for two uncontrollable variables; first, a massive flaw of the telephone is that it works<br>
	both ways. And second, in life it always seems that you run into the people you’d rather not. It’s funny that this blunt utilitarianism has infected<br>
	just this one annoying aspect of my life. When I think about it deeper, I think this stems from a desire that I have to make things fit into clear<br>
	categories. You’re either in my contact and I talk to you frequently or you’re not and I don’t. This removes entirely the maybe, the occasionally,<br>
	the rekindling. More importantly It removes grace and forgiveness. Lose my number taken to heart. It is almost always a way of avoiding people. Placing<br>
	them forever in the not speaking category of my life. Its shocking to realize that within me is a desire to destroy connection. When all life is IS<br>
	connection – connection of all living things on the living planet with the living God. Humanity has a great power, to build or destroy; to connect or<br>
	sever. Today I will keep everyone in my contact list. I will reach out – connect!<br>

   <i>Some Thoughts on Technology</i><br><br>

 I had an entire different Reed planned out for today, but after running into several technical issues, I lost the file. And surely I could re-write<br>
 it, but I think this is an even better opportunity to talk about technology. When I was young, my family was all but certain that I would one day <br>
 start my tech empire because I was able to play games on the family computer and when I unplugged the wifi, counted to 15, and plugged it back in,<br>
 it worked. Technology was something that I loved the fruits of as a child - it felt that it had no limit, I could be anyone and access anything. <br>
 As I got older I started to read books more and I felt a new kind of magic. one which surpassed the feeling that technology gave me as a child. <br?>
 I was exposed to new ideas and ways of looking at life (especially influential was Kerouac, Tolstoy, and Ellul). My late teens and early twenties<br>
 were defined by a desire to be connected to the world and to people. And I, granted not entirely in error, saw that the massive amounts of technology<br>
 that defined our lives; cars, computers, smart phones, and the endless feed of media, really seperated us from one another and creation. And I lived <br>
 for a few years as a wanna-be luddite. Now, seemingly a product of getting older, I see technology for what it is - simply a tool. A tool that is <br>
 often used for evil and for profit. Used to divide and conquer us. To distract and pacify, but ultimately a tool. A tool that should I choose, I <br>
 can use to share my love of life. Pivotal in my new understanding was the knowledge that not all technology has to been designed to be mindless. <br>
 Some computer operating systems are designed to be obtuse, making everything difficult. Cars with manual transmissions. Even printing out a map. <br>
 I've found a systhensis of being able to use these tools for good, but making them obtuse enough that they don't become as part of my life as <br>
 breathing, smiling, walking, feeling. It would be silly to eschew hammers because it allowed me to do something I couldn't do with my hands, but<br>
 at the same time it would be silly to make a hammer my entire identity. I am thankful for moderation and the ability to share the thoughts in my<br>
 mind with you all.<br>

   <i>I think...</i><br><br>

 I like to think a lot when I’m out on my daily walks in the park. To really let me mind run as wild as it wants – sometimes it’s crucial to reel<br>
 your mind in or else you’ll spiral, but like a dog on a retractable leash, it’s good to let it run! I think about all the people I see in the<br>
 park. Out walking and enjoying the day, playing with their children, or two lovers sitting and feeding the ducks. Everyone has their own memories<br>
 and thoughts and feelings, opinions which remain almost entirely unaccessable to me. And everyone has their own death they must die that they<br> 
 carry hidden within them. I wonder how they think about death and do they do so often?<br> 
 I think about the geese too – just as soon as they get settled from the big trek northward they’re heading back south for the winter. Are these<br>
 geese here the same ones as last year and next year will these same geese go else where? Where will they go to?<br>
 I think about smoking a cigarette (though, I haven’t had one in almost a year). Which gets me to thinking about all my friends. What joys and<br>
 struggles have they encountered today? I could reach out and call, but that would make everything real and tangible. I wouldn’t ponder any more,<br>
 but I would know. On my walks, the last thing I want is reality. When I walk, I try to communicate with something larger. The vast movement of<br>
 the Earth is real, I have to hold on tight, I’m spinning, all at once, thousand of miles per hour through space. My connection to every living<br>
 thing ceases to be religious doctrine because I realize that it’s obvious fact. The questions I have on my walks feel like questions in as much<br>
 as I ask them, but the fruit of the question isn’t in the answer, it’s in the asking and in the pondering!<br> 
	I love to walk and to walk and to feel alive It is important to me! To get out into the big connected world and to be the movement of creation!<br>

   <i>Ora Et Labora</i><br><br>

  It seems that in the mid-Atlantic summer is coming to a close. The heat has broken and a cool breeze blows the trees – soon all the tomatoes will<br>
  be harvested and inevitably I’ve found myself at work again. I thought for certain I would feel that remiss for not going to the beach more and a<br> 
  longing for long hours of solitude, but I felt new and alive. The cool morning air filled my lungs and I noticed that I hadn’t smelled the early<br> 
  morning in a long time. The beach air fills your lungs in a way that’s hot and full of sun, but the air that fills my lungs on a work day propels<br>
  me forward. I’m surprised too to find that I missed the down time in my job. When my body is working and my mind floats off elsewhere, or when I<br>
  am sitting and waiting in the space between the end of one task and the beginning of another. Time enough to think but not enough to sleep. In<br> 
  this down time I found incredible treasures that I had been seeking out all summer. In fact, I found the future of The Shaking Reed in one of these<br>
  layovers. When my mind is truly open and not distracted, it’s truly open to ideas to God. A vessel can’t be filled unless it is first emptied. It<br>
  reminds me what David Lynch said, “catching the big fish”. But sometimes just trying to open my mind I get all distracted – my labor and my lesiure<br>
  are tied. My labor is the bridge connecting the idea to my mind, it is ora et labora. The Smile on a child’s face, standing back to look on<br>
  projected completed, small talk with a coworker, and even the challenges of working too. All these are tools my mind uses to organize my thoughts.<br>
  Labor is what connects me to the world. Working diminishes the me that only thinks of me. To work is to acknowledge that we all need each other.<br>
  I leisure to labor so I can wait on God and the big ideas.<br><br>
