   <i>I think...</i><br><br>

 I like to think a lot when I’m out on my daily walks in the park. To really let me mind run as wild as it wants – sometimes it’s crucial to reel<br>
 your mind in or else you’ll spiral, but like a dog on a retractable leash, it’s good to let it run! I think about all the people I see in the<br>
 park. Out walking and enjoying the day, playing with their children, or two lovers sitting and feeding the ducks. Everyone has their own memories<br>
 and thoughts and feelings, opinions which remain almost entirely unaccessable to me. And everyone has their own death they must die that they<br> 
 carry hidden within them. I wonder how they think about death and do they do so often?<br> 
   I think about the geese too – just as soon as they get settled from the big trek northward they’re heading back south for the winter. Are these<br>
 geese here the same ones as last year and next year will these same geese go else where? Where will they go to?<br>
	I think about smoking a cigarette (though, I haven’t had one in almost a year). Which gets me to thinking about all my friends. What joys and<br>
 struggles have they encountered today? I could reach out and call, but that would make everything real and tangible. I wouldn’t ponder any more,<br>
 but I would know. On my walks, the last thing I want is reality. When I walk, I try to communicate with something larger. The vast movement of<br>
 the Earth is real, I have to hold on tight, I’m spinning, all at once, thousand of miles per hour through space. My connection to every living<br>
 thing ceases to be religious doctrine because I realize that it’s obvious fact. The questions I have on my walks feel like questions in as much<br>
 as I ask them, but the fruit of the question isn’t in the answer, it’s in the asking and in the pondering!<br> 
	I love to walk and to walk and to feel alive It is important to me! To get out into the big connected world and to be the movement of creation!<br><br><br>

   <i>Ora Et Labora</i><br><br>

  It seems that in the mid-Atlantic summer is coming to a close. The heat has broken and a cool breeze blows the trees – soon all the tomatoes will<br>
  be harvested and inevitably I’ve found myself at work again. I thought for certain I would feel that remiss for not going to the beach more and a<br> 
  longing for long hours of solitude, but I felt new and alive. The cool morning air filled my lungs and I noticed that I hadn’t smelled the early<br> 
  morning in a long time. The beach air fills your lungs in a way that’s hot and full of sun, but the air that fills my lungs on a work day propels<br>
  me forward. I’m surprised too to find that I missed the down time in my job. When my body is working and my mind floats off elsewhere, or when I<br>
  am sitting and waiting in the space between the end of one task and the beginning of another. Time enough to think but not enough to sleep. In<br> 
  this down time I found incredible treasures that I had been seeking out all summer. In fact, I found the future of The Shaking Reed in one of these<br>
  layovers. When my mind is truly open and not distracted, it’s truly open to ideas to God. A vessel can’t be filled unless it is first emptied. It<br>
  reminds me what David Lynch said, “catching the big fish”. But sometimes just trying to open my mind I get all distracted – my labor and my lesiure<br>
  are tied. My labor is the bridge connecting the idea to my mind, it is ora et labora. The Smile on a child’s face, standing back to look on<br>
  projected completed, small talk with a coworker, and even the challenges of working too. All these are tools my mind uses to organize my thoughts.<br>
  Labor is what connects me to the world. Working diminishes the me that only thinks of me. To work is to acknowledge that we all need each other.<br>
  I leisure to labor so I can wait on God and the big ideas.<br><br>
