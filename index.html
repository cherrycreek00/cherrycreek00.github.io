   <i>Ora Et Labora</i><br><br>

  It seems that in the mid-Atlantic summer is coming to a close. The heat has broken and a cool breeze blows the trees – soon all the tomatoes will<br>
  be harvested and inevitably I’ve found myself at work again. I thought for certain I would feel that remiss for not going to the beach more and a<br> 
  longing for long hours of solitude, but I felt new and alive. The cool morning air filled my lungs and I noticed that I hadn’t smelled the early<br> 
  morning in a long time. The beach air fills your lungs in a way that’s hot and full of sun, but the air that fills my lungs on a work day propels<br>
  me forward. I’m surprised too to find that I missed the down time in my job. When my body is working and my mind floats off elsewhere, or when I<br>
  am sitting and waiting in the space between the end of one task and the beginning of another. Time enough to think but not enough to sleep. In<br> 
  this down time I found incredible treasures that I had been seeking out all summer. In fact, I found the future of The Shaking Reed in one of these<br>
  layovers. When my mind is truly open and not distracted, it’s truly open to ideas to God. A vessel can’t be filled unless it is first emptied. It<br>
  reminds me what David Lynch said, “catching the big fish”. But sometimes just trying to open my mind I get all distracted – my labor and my lesiure<br>
  are tied. My labor is the bridge connecting the idea to my mind, it is ora et labora. The Smile on a child’s face, standing back to look on<br>
  projected completed, small talk with a coworker, and even the challenges of working too. All these are tools my mind uses to organize my thoughts.<br>
  Labor is what connects me to the world. Working diminishes the me that only thinks of me. To work is to acknowledge that we all need each other.<br>
  I leisure to labor so I can wait on God and the big ideas.<br><br>
