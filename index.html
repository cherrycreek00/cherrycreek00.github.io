	<i>Writing</i><br><br>
	<p>I'm really not in love with everything thing I write, in fact, once the words leave my mind and are committed to paper I can't stand to<br>
	read them. I'm sure this is abundantly clear to any eagle eyed reader of The Shaking Reed (or really any reader with a pulse) - typos abound<br>
	in each days entry. I'm not much of an editor anyway, but especially my inability to read what I've written makes mistakes lasting. Each piece<br>
	I write on here is a little piece of me which I send out into the world. I try and give each piece the love and nurturing it requires to grow up<br>
	and become its own, but posting on The Shaking Reed is each pieces leaving home - moving away to be its own thing. It's a heart breaking experience<br>
	but writing is a form of communication at the end of the day. A big notebook full of the greatest words written is nothing if it isn't read.<br>
	A beautiful experience too is reading my own writing that I've written long ago. The years make it not my own and instead of cringe at what <br>
	I've written, I see some greatness in it that I never saw before - as though someone else has written it. My goal with the new direction of The<br>
	Shaking Reed is to overcome this dislike of my writing new and to have an archive of my writing old. And largely to communicate, to hone my ability<br>
	to share the way I see the world with others.<br></p>

	<i>Failure</i><br><br>
	<p>I've been given many opportunities to fail lately, and I've taken every single one of them! Both because I recently started a job that<br>
	I'm not naturally gifted at, and because after a summer off, my driving skills are a little rusty - (and even working on the new life of<br>
	The Shaking Reed has given me chances to mess up things I've never had the opportunity to mess up before). Every day I've forgotten some<br>
	little detail, or mixed two such details up - zigged when I should have zagged. But the point isn't that I feel sorry for myself, in fact<br>
	I'm happy to be surrounded by all these mistakes, in my life I find the easiest way success is by failure. To fail at something is to learn<br>
	a very important lesson. Just reading or hearing about the way to do something is always shallow and I crave to get 'hands on' with a new <br>
	task and see how failure and success feels. Failure sets the goalpast by which success is measured. I've learned little by little to just <br>
	smile at little failures. This is due in large part due to the grace I've been granted as I get older and the way in which humility seems <br>
	to naturally be cultivated. I think that if your humility doesn't increase with your age you're toast! We will never be perfect, but we can<br>
	be happy, caring, and persistent! What hasn't gotten any easier with age is when I fail my family and friends, letting down those whom I love<br>
	deeply. This always gives me the most dreadful gut flight feeling. It's painful to think that I can't be perfect to those that I hold to be<br>
	perfect toward me. Every day we must remind ourselves that we are not the originator of perfection, but it's caretaker. Through hard work<br>
	the fruits of perfection can be ours; humility, tenderness, and love. While I'm not prefect, if i cultivate these fruits, it will get me much<br>
	closer.</p><br>

	<i>Sunlight Filtering Through</i><br><br>
	With sunlight filtering through my window these days begin sleepily, the days of my life that are forgotten - lay blank in my journal.<br>
	With sunlight filtering through pine tree needles warmly like stained glass, those days of life where the most noteworth thing is a <br>
	gentle northbound wind that gives momentary relief from the oppressive heat of the day, or days in spent in contemplation, inactive <br>
	as though accidentally. When dinner looms large and the smell of chickpeas roasting with plenty of tomatoes fills the kitchen. These days<br>
	are the currency of life with which we buy our way into Heaven. Happy contemplation and happily content. Time spent with my beloved, but<br>
	do I treasure these rightly? Herein, between life's great joys and great sorrows is the meat of life - but forgotten.<br>

	<i>Address Book</i><br><br>

	This morning I got a call from a number I didn’t have saved in my contacts, so I answered the way that I answer all calls, in a thick fog of confusion<br>
	(it turned out to be just a coworker confirming plans for the coming day). A huge chunk of all my phone interactions go like this. A number reaching<br>
	out to me that I’m almost certain I know, but am unable to place it. Each time I play along, hoping to figure out who it is based on context clues,<br>
	but I’m sure that my confusion is obvious.<br> 
    One of my worst habits is to periodically (or weekly), I go through my phone and prune my contacts – removing people I haven’t spoke to in a while or<br>
	who maybe I think it best not to talk to. The idea seems to be that if if the contact is out of sight then it is truly and forever out of mind. This<br>
	theory that my mind has come up with would be perfect if not for two uncontrollable variables; first, a massive flaw of the telephone is that it works<br>
	both ways. And second, in life it always seems that you run into the people you’d rather not. It’s funny that this blunt utilitarianism has infected<br>
	just this one annoying aspect of my life. When I think about it deeper, I think this stems from a desire that I have to make things fit into clear<br>
	categories. You’re either in my contact and I talk to you frequently or you’re not and I don’t. This removes entirely the maybe, the occasionally,<br>
	the rekindling. More importantly It removes grace and forgiveness. Lose my number taken to heart. It is almost always a way of avoiding people. Placing<br>
	them forever in the not speaking category of my life. Its shocking to realize that within me is a desire to destroy connection. When all life is IS<br>
	connection – connection of all living things on the living planet with the living God. Humanity has a great power, to build or destroy; to connect or<br>
	sever. Today I will keep everyone in my contact list. I will reach out – connect!<br>

   <i>Some Thoughts on Technology</i><br><br>

 I had an entire different Reed planned out for today, but after running into several technical issues, I lost the file. And surely I could re-write<br>
 it, but I think this is an even better opportunity to talk about technology. When I was young, my family was all but certain that I would one day <br>
 start my tech empire because I was able to play games on the family computer and when I unplugged the wifi, counted to 15, and plugged it back in,<br>
 it worked. Technology was something that I loved the fruits of as a child - it felt that it had no limit, I could be anyone and access anything. <br>
 As I got older I started to read books more and I felt a new kind of magic. one which surpassed the feeling that technology gave me as a child. <br?>
 I was exposed to new ideas and ways of looking at life (especially influential was Kerouac, Tolstoy, and Ellul). My late teens and early twenties<br>
 were defined by a desire to be connected to the world and to people. And I, granted not entirely in error, saw that the massive amounts of technology<br>
 that defined our lives; cars, computers, smart phones, and the endless feed of media, really seperated us from one another and creation. And I lived <br>
 for a few years as a wanna-be luddite. Now, seemingly a product of getting older, I see technology for what it is - simply a tool. A tool that is <br>
 often used for evil and for profit. Used to divide and conquer us. To distract and pacify, but ultimately a tool. A tool that should I choose, I <br>
 can use to share my love of life. Pivotal in my new understanding was the knowledge that not all technology has to been designed to be mindless. <br>
 Some computer operating systems are designed to be obtuse, making everything difficult. Cars with manual transmissions. Even printing out a map. <br>
 I've found a systhensis of being able to use these tools for good, but making them obtuse enough that they don't become as part of my life as <br>
 breathing, smiling, walking, feeling. It would be silly to eschew hammers because it allowed me to do something I couldn't do with my hands, but<br>
 at the same time it would be silly to make a hammer my entire identity. I am thankful for moderation and the ability to share the thoughts in my<br>
 mind with you all.<br>

   <i>I think...</i><br><br>

 I like to think a lot when I’m out on my daily walks in the park. To really let me mind run as wild as it wants – sometimes it’s crucial to reel<br>
 your mind in or else you’ll spiral, but like a dog on a retractable leash, it’s good to let it run! I think about all the people I see in the<br>
 park. Out walking and enjoying the day, playing with their children, or two lovers sitting and feeding the ducks. Everyone has their own memories<br>
 and thoughts and feelings, opinions which remain almost entirely unaccessable to me. And everyone has their own death they must die that they<br> 
 carry hidden within them. I wonder how they think about death and do they do so often?<br> 
 I think about the geese too – just as soon as they get settled from the big trek northward they’re heading back south for the winter. Are these<br>
 geese here the same ones as last year and next year will these same geese go else where? Where will they go to?<br>
 I think about smoking a cigarette (though, I haven’t had one in almost a year). Which gets me to thinking about all my friends. What joys and<br>
 struggles have they encountered today? I could reach out and call, but that would make everything real and tangible. I wouldn’t ponder any more,<br>
 but I would know. On my walks, the last thing I want is reality. When I walk, I try to communicate with something larger. The vast movement of<br>
 the Earth is real, I have to hold on tight, I’m spinning, all at once, thousand of miles per hour through space. My connection to every living<br>
 thing ceases to be religious doctrine because I realize that it’s obvious fact. The questions I have on my walks feel like questions in as much<br>
 as I ask them, but the fruit of the question isn’t in the answer, it’s in the asking and in the pondering!<br> 
	I love to walk and to walk and to feel alive It is important to me! To get out into the big connected world and to be the movement of creation!<br>

   <i>Ora Et Labora</i><br><br>

  It seems that in the mid-Atlantic summer is coming to a close. The heat has broken and a cool breeze blows the trees – soon all the tomatoes will<br>
  be harvested and inevitably I’ve found myself at work again. I thought for certain I would feel that remiss for not going to the beach more and a<br> 
  longing for long hours of solitude, but I felt new and alive. The cool morning air filled my lungs and I noticed that I hadn’t smelled the early<br> 
  morning in a long time. The beach air fills your lungs in a way that’s hot and full of sun, but the air that fills my lungs on a work day propels<br>
  me forward. I’m surprised too to find that I missed the down time in my job. When my body is working and my mind floats off elsewhere, or when I<br>
  am sitting and waiting in the space between the end of one task and the beginning of another. Time enough to think but not enough to sleep. In<br> 
  this down time I found incredible treasures that I had been seeking out all summer. In fact, I found the future of The Shaking Reed in one of these<br>
  layovers. When my mind is truly open and not distracted, it’s truly open to ideas to God. A vessel can’t be filled unless it is first emptied. It<br>
  reminds me what David Lynch said, “catching the big fish”. But sometimes just trying to open my mind I get all distracted – my labor and my lesiure<br>
  are tied. My labor is the bridge connecting the idea to my mind, it is ora et labora. The Smile on a child’s face, standing back to look on<br>
  projected completed, small talk with a coworker, and even the challenges of working too. All these are tools my mind uses to organize my thoughts.<br>
  Labor is what connects me to the world. Working diminishes the me that only thinks of me. To work is to acknowledge that we all need each other.<br>
  I leisure to labor so I can wait on God and the big ideas.<br><br>
