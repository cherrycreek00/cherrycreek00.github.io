"What went ye out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken with the wind?" (Matthew 11:7)<br><br>
The Shaking Reed is the infinite expanse on the prairie -- silence that explodes in every direction, the shadow of death and dying. Human frailty spotted from around corners. It is the reality that is sought and the deafening thuss of bass. It is everything base in man, and all his holy aspirations - arms stretched skyward toward his Heavenly home. Words dictated to man by the Holy Ghost and words found in junk drawers or under bus stops. It is searching for the footprints of Christ in the sand. An attempt for me to figure something out and to document that process, or maybe to document my life, to see if it means anything to me or to anybody else. To see if living life is different than the act of documenting it. It is purely Biblical in its approach to life, but not in the way claimed by popular culture, or conservative culture, nor that by liberal Christianity, but a Biblicalism that centers on the heart. The Bible, meditated on in its entirety, taken in full to the very core of my heart. Inspired by the Desert Fathers; eschewing all knowledge and learning - discernment and voices that lead to wayward places. <br><br>

"Judge not that ye be not judged" (Matthew 7: 1-3)<br><br>

If life is judged, it cannot be viewed in its entirety, and thus becomes lesser than reality. It is the author's opinion that the entirety of the world (himself included) lives in a varying degree of understanding; true understanding of what is really here. The Shaking Reed is a vehicle through which is becoming - purely and simply becoming.<br><br>

"For Behold, the Kingdom of God is within you" (Luke 17:21) <br><br>

The answers are within us. Should anyone tell another to look here or there, that is antithetical to Shaking Reed.
For me personally, as The Shaking Reed's main contributor, The Shaking Reed is my plea for forgiveness for everyone. Not a justification, but an opening up of the brokenness that lives inside humanity. To be honest in the confession of my life. To write only that which I know and have lived. To write speculatively but never ignorantly. For me the Shaking Reed is the night sky on which the stars are written - the ever expanding expanse contained in the prairie. The scroll that is unloosened at my judgment. <br><br>
At its smallest, the Shaking Reed is the reed which is shaken by the wind. The winds that fill the earth and emanate from countless sources. The ideologies that blow us, and the falsehoods, the ungrounded hopes and empty ambitions. The shaken reed cannot help but be honest, for it is shaken not by its own volition, but by outside influence - seeking only stillness and peace.<br><br>
"The wind bloweth where is listeth and thou hearest the sound thereof but canst not tell where is cometh and whither it goeth, so is everyone that is born of the spirit" (John 3:8)<br><br>
You are invited to watch this reed blow helter skelter. You are invited to blow, to shake, and be still.<br><br>
"The days of our years are threescore years and ten; and if by reason of strength they be fourscore years, yet is their strength labour and sorrow; for it is soon cut off and we fly away" (Psalm 90:10)<br><br>
Our experience is short and fleeting. Everyone is dead or is dying. May we all come together in fragility and tenderness. With compassion and love, with simple hearts and minds which are dull. For in our darkness we have each other and this is our comfort. The Shaking Reed is community - if only a community of two, two friends who love to write and tinker. With a passion for obscurity and webpages in the unexplored reaches of the internet. Please, won't you join us in the wilderness?<br><br>
